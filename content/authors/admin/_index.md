## About Me

I am an Established Researcher at ETH Zürich, Switzerland, hosted by the <a href="https://disco.ethz.ch/">Distributed Computing (DISCO)</a> group. Since September 2025, I am an SNSF Ambizione Fellow under the <a href="https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/223443">eDIAMOND</a> project.
<!-- Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Mobile Networking and Distributed Artificial Intelligence in the <a href="https://www.cds.unibe.ch/">Communication and Distributed Systems (CDS)</a>  group at the University of Bern, Switzerland. -->

My research focuses on Decentralized and Distributed Artificial Intelligence on Mobile Resource-constrained Networks. I study methods to design and operate systems in which a large number of independent mobile devices with limited computation, communication, energy, and sensing capacity cooperate to build a global intelligence through opportunistic knowledge exchange and workload sharing.
