This project targets Vehicular Ad-Hoc NETworks (VANETs) supporting delay-tolerant and bandwidth-demanding infotainment services as well as safety critical applications which require stable links, low latency and the lowest possible packet loss rate. The applications will make use of V2V, and/or V2I communications.
