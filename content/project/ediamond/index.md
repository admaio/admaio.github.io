The eDIAMOND project researches data driven and analytical methods for modeling wireless communication and distributing large-model artificial intelligence over large-scale Internet of Things.
It will develop adaptive, IoT-native methods for model architecture design. It will also design optimal, analytical and data driven methods for multi-objective, throughput-delay-aware allocation of data flows in multi-hop mobile wireless networks.
