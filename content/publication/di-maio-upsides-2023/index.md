abstract: In dynamic settings, fully distributed gossip-based learning schemes have
  recently gained interest due to their better scalability, robustness, and enhanced
  privacy protection compared to server-based architectures. However, existing approaches
  to their performance characterization either assume stable connectivity among nodes
  or are ad-hoc for specific trace-based mobility patterns. Thus, in dynamic settings,
  there is currently a poor understanding of the conditions under which gossip-based
  learning schemes are feasible, and of their main performance tradeoffs. In this
  work, we start addressing this issue by performing a first baselining of Gossip
  Learning (GL) on random Time-Varying Graphs (TVG), to get a first-order characterization
  of their main performance patterns in dynamic settings. The use of random TVG enables
  a fine-grained and accurate characterization of GL effectiveness as a function of
  the main system parameters while abstracting from scenariospecific features of patterns
  of communication and mobility (e.g., induced by road grids or measured mobility
  traces). Our results suggest that GL schemes are robust to node mobility and comparable
  in accuracy and convergence speed to Federated Learning architectures, over a wide
  range of operational conditions. We show that the final model accuracy is robust
  against data dispersion across nodes as well as against very low rates of exchanges
  across nodes.
