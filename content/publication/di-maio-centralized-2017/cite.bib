 abstract = {Floating Content (FC) has recently been proposed as an attractive application for mobile networks, such as VANETs, to operate opportunistic and distributed content sharing over a given geographic area, namely Anchor Zone (AZ). FC performances are tightly dependent on the AZ size, which in literature is classically chosen by the node that generates the floating message. In the present work, we propose a method to improve FC performances by optimizing the AZ size with the support of a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller, which collects mobility information, such as speed and position, of the vehicles in its coverage range.},
