abstract: Floating Content (FC) has recently been proposed as an attractive application
  for mobile networks, such as VANETs, to operate opportunistic and distributed content
  sharing over a given geographic area, namely Anchor Zone (AZ). FC performances are
  tightly dependent on the AZ size, which in literature is classically chosen by the
  node that generates the floating message. In the present work, we propose a method
  to improve FC performances by optimizing the AZ size with the support of a Software
  Defined Network (SDN) controller, which collects mobility information, such as speed
  and position, of the vehicles in its coverage range.
