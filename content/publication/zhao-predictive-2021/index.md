abstract: In modern networks, edge computing will be responsible for processing and
  learning from the critical network- and user-generated data, such as wireless link
  usage, mobility information, application requests, and many others. The presence
  of Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) applications at the edge of the network will
  enable the network to predict necessary user behavior and its impact on network
  infrastructure, such as base station overloading. One of the main strategies for
  offloading users and base stations is to deploy UAV base stations, or flying base
  stations, which can dynamically provide service and connectivity. In this article,
  we introduce a framework for distributed learning over Multi-access Edge Computing
  (MEC), which manages data applications in a fully distributed setting across edge
  servers, thus reducing the cost of collecting user information in a centralized
  server. We couple the proposed distributed learning with a novel similarity metric
  for user trajectories, which can aggregate neural network models with similar costs
  as other model aggregation techniques. However, the aggregation technique can achieve
  much higher accuracy. Furthermore, we apply the proposed distributed learning scheme
  to manage and deploy flying base stations to areas that experience high demand or
  poor user connectivity, thus optimizing connectivity in terms of user satisfaction,
  delay, and network throughput.
