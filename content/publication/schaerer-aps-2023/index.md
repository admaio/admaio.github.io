abstract: With the fast growth of the Internet ofThings, location-based services are
  becoming more important for quality-relevantapplications. Quality-relevant applications
  often require to be auditable inorder to ensure quality of products and services.
  However, positioning systemstypically only provide position claims that are not
  secured and can be forgedor manipulated. This work proposes an auditable positioning
  system to tacklethis issue. The proposed system performs a proof of location to
  assert that thetracked asset tag was at the claimed position and immutably stores
  thisinformation on a distributed ledger. Additionally, an adaptive storage rate
  wasproposed to save disk storage on the distributed ledgers. A testbed based onBluetooth's
  Angle of Arrival positioning was implemented for the evaluation ofthe auditable
  positioning system. The evaluation shows that auditablepositioning is secure, feasible
  for low-power devices, and that adaptivestorage rates can significantly reduce disk
  usage and improve scalability.
