abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become popular in the field of mobility and
  trajectory prediction due to its privacy-preserving and scalability capabilities.
  Deploying FL over resource-constrained devices and varying network conditions is
  challenging for achieving a good tradeoff among prediction performance, computational
  load, and communication volume. On the other hand, the design of FL’s distributed
  neural architectures is complex, time-consuming, and dependent on experts’ prior
  knowledge. To tackle the above limitations, we propose the network-adaptive FEDerated
  learning for reinFORCEd mobility prediction (FedForce) system. FedForce employs
  reinforcement learning to design a transformer neural network whose architecture
  jointly optimizes the prediction accuracy, training time, and transmission time
  based on the mobility dataset’s unique features, the client’s computing capacity,
  and the available network throughput. FedForce outperforms several state-of-theart
  trajectory predictors and achieves an average displacement error of 0.20m on the
  ETH+UCY dataset and an accuracy of 76% on the Orange dataset (-0.02m and 10% higher
  than the bestperforming baseline, respectively), while cutting the FL training and
  transmission time by half. FedForce can save up to 80% of computational resources
  and 96% of communication overheads with a negligible accuracy decrease.
