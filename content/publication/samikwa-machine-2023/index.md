abstract: 'The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) temperature sensors in urban
  areas is essential for the monitoring and understanding of the thermal environment.
  However, accurate temperature measurements can be compromised by factors such as
  direct sunlight, leading to overheating and inaccurate readings. We propose a Machine
  Learning-based approach that addresses this challenge by dynamically ventilating
  the sensor environment using small fans, enabling accurate and energy-efficient
  temperature measurements. This paper focuses on two interconnected problems: predicting
  steady-state temperature using a limited window of initial temperature measurements
  and investigating the impact of ventilation time. We employ various DNNs suitable
  for low-power IoT sensor devices to predict temperature using multivariate time
  series from different sensors and compare their accuracy. Furthermore, we highlight
  the tradeoff between prediction accuracy, which is correlated to the length of the
  observed input sequence, and energy consumption dependent on ventilation time. By
  adopting advanced prediction techniques, we can develop efficient IoT systems for
  accurate and energy-efficient environment monitoring in smart cities.'
