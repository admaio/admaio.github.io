 abstract = {The next generation of Virtual Reality (VR) applications is expected to provide advanced experiences through Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) content, which requires higher data rates and ultra-low latency. In this article, we refactor 6DoF VR applications into atomic services to increase the computing capacity of VR systems aiming to reduce the end-to-end (E2E) of 6DoF VR applications. Those services are chained and deployed across Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers in high mobility scenarios over real-edge network topologies. We investigate the Distributed Service Chain Problem (DSCP) to find the optimal service placement of services from a service chain such that its E2E latency does not exceed 5 ms. The DSCP problem is \mathcal NP -hard. We provide an integer linear program to model the system, along with a heuristic, namely disTributed sErvice chaiN orchEstraTor (TENET), which is one order of magnitude faster than optimally solving the DSCP problem. We compare TENET to DSCP implementation and well-known service migration algorithms in terms of E2E latency, power consumption, video resolution selection based on E2E latency, context migrations, and execution time. We observe a significant reduction of E2E latency and gains in more advanced video resolution selection and accepted context service migrations when using TENET’s deployment strategy on VR services.},
