abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has rapidly become a crucial paradigm for training
  Machine Learning (ML) models when datasets are spread across several devices without
  compromising the privacy of the data owners. In vehicular networks, FL can be used
  to train driving models and object detection and classification over sensitive datasets
  to continuously improve user experience and driving safety. However, the majority
  of FL implementations cannot efficiently filter malicious vehicular users and low-quality
  contributions. This article proposes Distributed OT-based Federated Learning (DOTFL),
  an aggregation mechanism based on the clustering of the received trained Neural
  Networks Neural Network (NN) at the vehicular devices and on outlier detection.
  The proposed mechanism can detect malicious contributions by comparing them to previously
  received contributions and following a clustering approach. Furthermore, the convergence
  time of the FL process is improved by distributing trained NN weights directly through
  vehicle-to-vehicle links. Experimental analysis shows an improvement of up to 22%
  in terms of accuracy compared to state-of-the-art FL approaches. This is achieved
  by using clustering models and removing outliers, enabling a significantly lower
  presence of malicious contributions in aggregated models.
