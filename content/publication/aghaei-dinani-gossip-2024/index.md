abstract: Fully distributed learning schemes based on opportunistic exchanges among
  nodes, such as Gossip Learning (GL), have recently attracted attention due to their
  superior scalability, robustness, and enhanced privacy protection. However, their
  performance has only been characterized in static or application-specific trace-driven
  mobility scenarios, overlooking the issue of understanding how the structure of
  the interactions among nodes over time affects the learning process. To address
  this gap, we propose a new assessment approach for GL in dynamic settings, based
  on two novel classes of time-varying random graphs, which extend Erdős-Rényi (ER)
  and Barabási-Albert (BA) random graphs to characterize generic real-world dynamic
  networks (e.g., social or wireless networks), while accounting for node churn and
  the rate at which the graph evolves. Evaluating GL on such time-varying graphs allows
  us to abstract the relationship between the key parameters of GL algorithms, the
  communication and topology patterns, and the learning performance from factors specific
  to the experimental contexts, generalizing our findings to a large class of real-world
  networks. Simulation results show that the sparser the graph, the higher the positive
  impact edge dynamicity has on GL mean accuracy and convergence time. Surprisingly,
  we observe that in networks with the same average connectivity degree, regardless
  of their nodes’ attachment style, a higher edge persistence reduces GL mean accuracy
  and convergence time, highlighting the value of a varied interaction among nodes.
  Finally, results show that real-world networks that exhibit preferential attachment
  can preserve a better GL performance in terms of mean accuracy and convergence time
  than random networks (i.e., ER-like), even under high node churn and edge dynamicity.
