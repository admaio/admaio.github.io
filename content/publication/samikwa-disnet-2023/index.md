abstract: The key impediments to deploying deep neural networks (DNN) in IoT edge
  environments lie in the gap between the expensive DNN computation and the limited
  computing capability of IoT devices. Current state-of-the-art Machine Learning models
  have significant demands on memory, computation, and energy and raise challenges
  for integrating them with the decentralized operation of heterogeneous and resource-constrained
  IoT devices. Recent studies have proposed the cooperative execution of DNN models
  in IoT devices to enhance the reliability, privacy, and efficiency of intelligent
  IoT systems but disregarded flexible fine-grained model partitioning schemes for
  optimal distribution of DNN execution tasks in dynamic IoT networks. In this paper,
  we propose DISNET, a distributed micro-split deep learning scheme for heterogeneous
  dynamic IoT. DISNET accelerates inference time and minimizes energy consumption
  by combining vertical (layer-based) and horizontal DNN partitioning to enable flexible,
  distributed, and parallel execution of neural network models on heterogeneous IoT
  devices. DISNET considers the IoT devices’ computing and communication resources
  and the network conditions for resource-aware cooperative DNN Inference. Experimental
  evaluation in dynamic IoT networks shows that DISNET reduces the DNN inference latency
  and energy consumption by up to 5.2× and 6×, respectively, compared to two state-of-the-art
  schemes without loss of accuracy.
