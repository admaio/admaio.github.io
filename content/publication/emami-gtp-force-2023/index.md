abstract: This paper introduces Game-theoretic Trajectory Prediction through distributed
  reinForcement learning (GTPForce), a system that tackles the challenge of predicting
  joint pedestrian trajectories in multi-agent scenarios. GTP-Force utilizes decentralized
  reinforcement learning agents to personalize neural networks for each competing
  player based on their noncooperative preferences and social interactions with others.
  By identifying the Nash Equilibria, GTP-Force accurately predicts joint trajectories
  while minimizing overall system loss in noncooperative environments. The system
  outperforms existing stateof- the-art trajectory predictors, achieving an average
  displacement error of 0.19m on the ETH+UCY dataset and 80% accuracy on the Orange
  dataset, which is -0.03m and 5% better than the best-performing baseline, respectively.
  Additionally, GTP-Force considerably reduces the model size of social mobility predictors
  compared to approaches with classical game theory.
