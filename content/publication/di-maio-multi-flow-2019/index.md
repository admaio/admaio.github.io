abstract: 5G-enabled vehicular networks will soon allow their users to exchange safety
  and non-safety related information over heterogeneous communication interfaces.
  Routing vehicular data flows over multi-hop Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications
  is one of the hardest challenges in vehicular networking, and it has been tackled
  in literature by using distributed algorithms. The distributed approach has shown
  significant inefficiencies in such dynamic vehicular scenarios, mainly due to poor
  network congestion control. To overcome the complexity of the envisioned architecture,
  and the inefficiency of distributed routing algorithms, we hereby propose to leverage
  the coordination capabilities of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to determine
  optimal V2V multi-hop paths and to offload traffic from the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure-to-Vehicle
  (V2I2V) to the V2V communications, using both cellular and Wi-Fi technologies. In
  order to achieve this goal, we propose Multi-Flow Congestion-Aware Routing (MFCAR),
  a centralized routing algorithm that relies on graph theory to choose short and
  uncongested V2V paths. Realistic simulations prove that MFCAR outperforms well-
  established centralized routing algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra's) in terms of Packet
  Delivery Ratio (PDR), goodput and average packet delay, up to a five-fold performance
  gain.
