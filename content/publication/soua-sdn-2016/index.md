abstract: Content dissemination in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks has a myriad of applications,
  ranging from advertising and parking notifications, to traffic and emergency warnings.
  This heterogeneity requires optimizing content storing, retrieval and forwarding
  among vehicles to deliver data with short latency and without jeopardizing network
  resources. In this paper, for a few reference scenarios, we illustrate how approaches
  that combine Content Centric Networking (CCN) and Floating Content (FC) enable new
  and efficient solutions to this issue. Moreover, we describe how a network architecture
  based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) can support both CCN and FC by coordinating
  distributed caching strategies, by optimizing the packet forwarding process and
  the availability of floating data items. For each scenario analyzed, we highlight
  the main research challenges open, and we describe a few possible solutions.
