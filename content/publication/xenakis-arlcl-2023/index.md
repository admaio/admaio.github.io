abstract: Positioning estimations of wireless sensors can be enhanced via sensor collaboration.
  To enable this, various methods have been proposed; yet, most do not leverage the
  entire collective knowledge, which also involves the estimation’s uncertainty. In
  this article, we introduce Anchor-free Ranging-Likelihood-based Cooperative Localization
  (ARLCL); a novel anchor-free and technology-agnostic localization algorithm that
  utilizes inter-exchanged ranging signals from sensors to enable their simultaneous
  positioning. Ranging technologies with easy-to-model propagation properties, such
  as UWB or LiDAR are among the first beneficiaries that ARLCL is targeting. To examine
  its applicability, however, even to signals that are noisier and often unsuitable
  for ranging, we assess ARLCL with real-world BLE RSS measurements. At the same time,
  we consider deployments that typically induce flip-ambiguity, being a major problem
  in cooperative localization. We provide an extensive comparison against the most
  widely-adopted optimization method (Mass-Spring) but also against the recent likelihood-based
  approach (Maximum Likelihood - Particle Swarm Optimization). The results showed
  that ARLCL outperformed the baselines in almost all scenarios. Our gain in positioning
  accuracy is also found to be positively correlated to both the swarm’s size and
  the signal’s quality, reaching an improvement of 40%.
