abstract: The key impediments to deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) in Internet
  of Things (IoT) edge environments lie in the gap between the expensive DNN computation
  and the limited computing capability of IoT devices. Current state-of-the-art machine
  learning models have significant demands on memory, computation, and energy and
  raise challenges for integrating them with the decentralized operation of heterogeneous
  and resource-constrained IoT devices. Recent studies have proposed the cooperative
  execution of DNN models in IoT devices to enhance the reliability, privacy, and
  efficiency of intelligent IoT systems but disregarded flexible fine-grained model
  partitioning schemes for optimal distribution of DNN execution tasks in dynamic
  IoT networks. In this article, we propose distributed micro-split deep learning
  in heterogeneous dynamic IoT (DISNET). DISNET accelerates inference time and minimizes
  energy consumption by combining vertical (layer based) and horizontal DNN partitioning
  to enable flexible, distributed, and parallel execution of neural network models
  on heterogeneous IoT devices. DISNET considers the IoT devices’ computing and communication
  resources and the network conditions for resource-aware cooperative DNN Inference.
  Experimental evaluation in dynamic IoT networks shows that DISNET reduces the DNN
  inference latency and energy consumption by up to 5.2times and 6times , respectively,
  compared to two state-of-the-art schemes without loss of accuracy.
