abstract: 'Predicting mobile users’ trajectories accurately is essential for improving
  the performance of wireless networks and autonomous systems. In this paper, we tackle
  the problem of trajectory prediction in a multi-agent scenario where the social
  interaction among users is taken into consideration.We propose Intra- Cluster Reinforced
  Social Transformer (INTRAFORCE), a novel system to design and train Social-Transformer
  neural networks that learn the spatio-temporal interactions among neighboring mobile
  users and predict their joint future trajectories. Unlike state-of-the-art social-aware
  trajectory predictors that either miss the large-distance interactions or are computationally
  expensive due to the pooling of all users’ interactions, INTRAFORCE clusters users
  with similar trajectories and learns their interactions. INTRAFORCE performs Neural
  Architecture Search to optimize each transformer’s architecture to fit each cluster’s
  user mobility features using Reinforcement Learning. Through experimental validation,
  we show that INTRAFORCE outperforms several state-of-the-art trajectory predictors
  on five widely used smallscale pedestrian mobility datasets and one large-scale
  privacyoriented cellular mobility dataset by achieving lower prediction error, training
  time, and computational complexity. Keywords: Social-aware Trajectory Prediction,
  Transformers, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Architecture Search, Clustering.'
