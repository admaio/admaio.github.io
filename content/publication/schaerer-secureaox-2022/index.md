abstract: The Constant Tone Extension that enables Angle of Arrival direction finding
  in Bluetooth Low Energy is not protected. Therefore, an attacker might be able to
  manipulate or forge locations. SecureAoX uses basic cryptographic functions and
  the contradictions between the Angle of Arrival measured on the anchor points and
  the Angle of Departure measured on the asset tag to verify location claims and detect
  manipulated and forged locations. A Monte Carlo simulation used to evaluate the
  performance of the detection algorithm shows that the approach is efficient in detecting
  attacks and real-world Angle of Arrival accuracy measurements show that the approach
  is feasible in real-world scenarios. In conclusion, SecureAoX can detect forged
  and manipulated positions that are further away from the attacked positions than
  the uncertainty of the used Positioning System.
