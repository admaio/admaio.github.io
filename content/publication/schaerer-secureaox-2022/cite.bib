 abstract = {The Constant Tone Extension that enables Angle of Arrival direction finding in Bluetooth Low Energy is not protected. Therefore, an attacker might be able to manipulate or forge locations. SecureAoX uses basic cryptographic functions and the contradictions between the Angle of Arrival measured on the anchor points and the Angle of Departure measured on the asset tag to verify location claims and detect manipulated and forged locations. A Monte Carlo simulation used to evaluate the performance of the detection algorithm shows that the approach is efficient in detecting attacks and real-world Angle of Arrival accuracy measurements show that the approach is feasible in real-world scenarios. In conclusion, SecureAoX can detect forged and manipulated positions that are further away from the attacked positions than the uncertainty of the used Positioning System.},
