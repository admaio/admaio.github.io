abstract: The emergence and adoption of mobile smartphones and their ubiquitous use
  by mobile phone users provide a distinctive opportunity for the collection of multi-modal
  sensor data. The data collected from such smartphone devices can be used to observe,
  recognize and predict patterns in user behaviors such as physical activity, psycho-physiological
  conditions such as affective state, personality traits such as extraversion, emotionality,
  and honesty-humility, as well as other mental health-related or psychological variables.
  In this work, we design and develop a system that can be used for the unobtrusive
  collection and storage of anonymized smartphone sensor data for personality detection
  and prediction. Our proposed system is developed across the two main smartphone
  operating systems to cover a wide range of users and to consider the available sensors
  across platform-dependent devices, as well as to account for distinctions in the
  personality traits of users of different operating systems. We present a correlation
  analysis and describe how the dataset collected from the smartphone sensors, which
  were deployed in a large-scale psychology study with about 200 participants, can
  be used to detect and predict different personality states.
