abstract: The demand for safe and secure journeys over roads and highways has been
  growing at a tremendous pace over recent decades. At the same time, the smart city
  paradigm has emerged to improve citizens’ quality of life by developing the smart
  mobility concept. Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) are widely recognized to be
  instrumental in realizing such concept, by enabling appealing safety and infotainment
  services. Such networks come with their own set of challenges, which range from
  managing high node mobility to securing data and user privacy. The Software Defined
  Networking (SDN) paradigm has been identified as a suitable solution for dealing
  with the dynamic network environment, the increased number of connected devices,
  and the heterogeneity of applications. While some preliminary investigations have
  been already conducted to check the applicability of the SDN paradigm to VANETs,
  and its presumed benefits for managing resources and mobility, it is still unclear
  what impact SDN will have on security and privacy. Security is a relevant issue
  in VANETs, because of the impact that threats can have on drivers’ behavior and
  quality of life. This paper opens a discussion on the security threats that future
  SDN-enabled VANETs will have to face, and investigates how SDN could be beneficial
  in building new countermeasures. The analysis is conducted in real use cases (smart
  parking, smart grid of electric vehicles, platooning, and emergency services), which
  are expected to be among the vehicular applications that will most benefit from
  introducing an SDN architecture.
