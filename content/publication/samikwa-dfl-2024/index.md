abstract: Federated Learning (FL) in edge Internet of Things (IoT) environments is
  challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of the learning environment, mainly
  embodied in two aspects. Firstly, the statistically heterogeneous data, usually
  non-independent identically distributed (non-IID), from geographically distributed
  clients can deteriorate the FL training accuracy. Secondly, the heterogeneous computing
  and communication resources in IoT devices often result in unstable training processes
  that slow down the training of a global model and affect energy consumption. Most
  existing solutions address only the unilateral side of the heterogeneity issue but
  neglect the joint problem of resources and data heterogeneity for the resource-constrained
  IoT. In this article, we propose Dynamic Federated split Learning (DFL) to address
  the joint problem of data and resource heterogeneity for distributed training in
  IoT. DFL enhances training efficiency in heterogeneous dynamic IoT through resource-aware
  split computing of deep neural networks and dynamic clustering of training participants
  based on the similarity of their sub-model layers. We evaluate DFL on a real testbed
  comprising heterogeneous IoT devices using two widely-adopted datasets, in various
  non-IID settings. Results show that DFL improves training performance in terms of
  training time by up to 48%, accuracy by up to 32%, and energy consumption by up
  to 62.8% compared to classic FL and Federated Split Learning in scenarios with both
  data and resource heterogeneity.
