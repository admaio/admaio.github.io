abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is widely applied in privacy-sensitive domains,
  such as healthcare, finance, and education, due to its privacy-preserving properties.
  However, implementing FL in dynamic wireless networks poses substantial communication
  challenges. Central to these challenges is the need for efficient communication
  strategies that can adapt to fluctuating network conditions and the growing number
  of participating devices, which can lead to unacceptable communication delays. In
  this article, we propose Stochastic Client Selection for Tree All-Reduce Federated
  Learning (CSTAR-FL), a novel approach that combines a probabilistic User Device
  (UD) selection strategy with a tree-based communication architecture to enhance
  communication efficiency in FL within densely populated wireless networks. By optimizing
  UD selection for effective model aggregation and employing an efficient data transmission
  structure, CSTAR-FL significantly reduces communication time and improves FL efficiency.
  Additionally, our approach ensures high global model accuracy under scenarios where
  data distribution is heterogeneous from uds. Extensive simulations in dynamic wireless
  network scenarios demonstrate that CSTAR-FL outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  methods, reducing model convergence time by up to 40% without losing the global
  model accuracy. This makes CSTAR-FL a robust solution for efficient and scalable
  FL deployments in high-density environments.
