abstract: The increasing interest in vehicular communications draws attention to scalability
  and network congestion problems and therefore on techniques to offload the traffic,
  typically carried through the infrastructure, to the Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network.
  Floating content (FC) represents a promising paradigm to share ephemeral content
  without direct support from infrastructure. It is based on constraining geographically
  within the Anchor Zone (AZ) the opportunistic replication of a given content among
  vehicles, in a way that strikes a balance between minimization of resource usage
  and content availability. Existing works on FC performance modeling are based on
  standard, homogeneous synthetic mobility models, and it is hence unclear how they
  actually fit in realistic mobility scenarios. Moreover, the approaches to FC dimensioning
  they propose assume users have full knowledge of Spatio-temporal mobility patterns,
  which is hard to achieve in practice. Finally, despite FC is an infrastructure-less
  communication paradigm, some form of infrastructure support could be available in
  the vast majority of those application scenarios for which it has been proposed.
  In this paper, we perform a first attempt at tackling these issues. We focus on
  how to dimension an Anchor Zone in a realistic vehicular scenario. We propose the
  first set of simple dimensioning strategies, based on the estimation of some key
  mobility parameters and of FC performance. We assess such strategies on measurement-based
  vehicular traces, providing a first indication of their relative performance, and
  of the feasibility of FC in practical scenarios.
