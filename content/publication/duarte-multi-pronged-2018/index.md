abstract: Content dissemination in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) has the potential
  to enable a myriad of applications, ranging from advertising, traffic and emergency
  warnings to infotainment. This variety in applications and services calls for mechanisms
  able to optimize content storing, retrieval and forwarding among vehicles, without
  jeopardizing network resources. Content Centric Networking (CCN), takes advantage
  of inherent content redundancy in the network in order to decrease the utilization
  of network resources, improve response time and content availability, coping efficiently
  with some of the effects of mobility. Floating Content (FC), on the other hand,
  holds potential to implement efficiently a large amount of vehicular applications
  thanks to its property of geographic content replication, while Software Defined
  Networking (SDN), is an attractive solution for the lack of flexibility and dynamic
  programmability that characterizes current VANET architectures. By implementing
  a logical centralization of the network, SDN enables dynamic and efficient management
  of network resources. In this paper, for a few reference scenarios, we illustrate
  how approaches that combine CCN, FC and SDN enable an innovative adaptive VANET
  architecture able to efficiently accommodate to intermittent connectivity, fluctuating
  node density and mobility patterns on one side and application performance and network
  resources on the other side, aiming to achieve high QoS. For each scenario, we highlight
  the main open research challenges, and we describe possible solutions to improve
  content dissemination and reduce replication without affecting content availability.
