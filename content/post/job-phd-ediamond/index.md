## The hosting group

The [**Distributed Computing (DISCO) Group**](http://disco.ethz.ch/publications.html) is a research group at ETH Zurich, led by [**Prof. Dr. Roger Wattenhofer**](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/wroger).
We are interested in a variety of research topics on new and upcoming areas off the beaten paths.
Our three main areas of research are machine learning, distributed systems, and theory of networks.
Within these three areas, we are currently working on several projects: graph neural networks, natural language processing, algorithmic learning, fault-tolerance, blockchains, consensus, cryptocurrencies, digital money, central bank digital currency, decentralized finance, financial networks, e-democracy, voting, social networks, online analysis with delay, and theory of distributed algorithms.
In our group, we work on both theory and practice: some members of our group focus on algorithms and mathematical proofs, and some on system design and building. 

## Job description

The Distributed Computing group at ETH Zurich is looking for a PhD candidate to work on the [**SNSF Ambizione 2023 project "eDIAMOND: Efficient Distributed Intelligent Applications in Mobile-Network Dynamics"**](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/223443), starting on 1 September 2025.
The eDIAMOND project aims at developing new methods and systems for decentralized and distributed data-driven methods for Federated Learning on resource-constrained networks.
Your research within the project will contribute towards your doctoral degree at ETH Zurich.
You will be supervised by [**Prof. Dr. Roger Wattenhofer**](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/wroger) and [**Dr. Antonio Di Maio**](https://admaio.github.io/).
<!-- During the project, you will have the opportunity to have inter-institutional, cross-border, international collaboration with other top-ranked universities. -->

You will be entrusted with designing, developing, and evaluating data-driven methods, algorithms, and systems for three independent but related research directions in the eDIAMOND project, namely:
1. Distributing model training and inference over a network of resource-constrained devices.
1. Online, context-aware adaptation of Federated Neural Network Architectures based on the available system resources (e.g., communication, computation, energy).
1. Communication-efficient knowledge exchange among networked federated large models.

These research directions allow you to gradually build your own research profile according to your interests, while remaining within the project's goals.
Each research direction is composed of a sequence of Tasks that will collectively achieve the project's goal.
For each Task, you will be responsible for the typical scientific research workflow: motivating the problem, identifying the main methodological shortcomings in the literature, design and develop novel systems, plan and execute experiments, and report findings in articles to be published at top venues according to the project's schedule.
Periodic meetings and feedback will ensure the success of your degree and of the project overall.

      - **Mathematics**: Statistical Learning, Stochastic Processes (e.g., Percolation Theory, Queuing Theory, Age of Information), Network Calculus, Graph Theory, Convex and Non-convex Optimization, Approximation Algorithms.
  1. An excellent **Master's degree** in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or other fields related to the project's domain, from a reputable university, to be obtained before 1 September 2025 (depending on visa requirements)
  1. A strong Transcript of Records, stating the list of passed exams (particularly those related to the project and the areas above) and their grades.
  1. Strong programming skills (i.e., Python and main Machine Learning frameworks such as Pytorch)
  1. Experience with scientific writing (e.g., reports, theses, and scientific articles)
  1. Strong critical thinking, English communication skills (oral and written), interpersonal abilities, collaboration aptitude.

Bonus points:
  - Published peer-reviewed articles on project-related topics in reputable conferences or journals
  - Experience with network simulators such as OMNeT++ or ns-3
