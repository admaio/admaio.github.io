## The hosting group

The [**Distributed Computing (DISCO) Group**](http://disco.ethz.ch/publications.html) is a research group at ETH Zürich, led by [**Prof. Dr. Roger Wattenhofer**](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/wroger).
We are interested in a variety of research topics on new and upcoming areas off the beaten paths. Our three main areas of research are machine learning, distributed systems, and theory of networks.
Within these three areas, we are currently working on several projects: graph neural networks, natural language processing, algorithmic learning, fault-tolerance, blockchains, consensus, cryptocurrencies, digital money, central bank digital currency, decentralized finance, financial networks, e-democracy, voting, social networks, online analysis with delay, and theory of distributed algorithms.

## Job description

The Distributed Computing group at the ETH Zürich is looking for a Ph.D. candidate for the upcoming [**SNSF Ambizione 2023 project "eDIAMOND: Efficient Distributed Intelligent Applications in Mobile-Network Dynamics"**](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/223443), which aims at developing new methods and systems for decentralized and distributed data-driven methods for Machine Learning on resource-constrained networks.

In particular, the new member will be entrusted with three independent but related research directions.
First, the candidate will develop data-driven methods for distributing model training and inference over a network of resource-constrained devices.
Second, the candidate will investigate methods for online adaptation of Federated Neural Network Architectures based on the available system resources, such as communication, computation, and energy.
Third, the candidate will study methods for communication-efficient knowledge exchange among federated large models.

The candidate will be supervised by [**Prof. Dr. Roger Wattenhofer**](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/wroger) and [**Dr. Antonio Di Maio**](https://admaio.github.io/).

## Your Profile

The candidate must have:
  - A strong interest and motivation to contribute to the eDIAMOND project's goals (see Job description section above)
  - An excellent Master degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or other fields related to the project's domain, from a reputable university and with a strong Transcript of Records.
  - Theoretical and practical experience with various Federated Learning paradigms, Decentralized and Distributed Systems, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in partially-observable environments
  - Strong programming skills (i.e., Python and main Machine Learning frameworks such as Pytorch)
  - Experience with scientific writing (e.g., reports, articles, theses)
  - Strong critical thinking, English communication skills (oral and written), and interpersonal abilities.

Bonus points:
  - Published peer-reviewed articles on project-related topics in reputable conferences or journals
  - Knowledge of wireless communications (e.g. IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, etc.) and computer networks at several layers, especially MAC, Network, and Transport.
  - Experience with network simulators such as OMNeT++ or NS-3
  - Experience with High Performance Computing (i.e., SLURM)
  - Experience with Git

## Your Workplace

ETH Zurich is a family-friendly employer with excellent working conditions. You can look forward to an exciting working environment, cultural diversity, and attractive offers and benefits.
In line with our values, ETH Zurich encourages an inclusive culture. We promote equality of opportunity, value diversity and nurture a working and learning environment in which the rights and dignity of all our staff and students are respected.

## How to apply

We look forward to receiving your online application with the following documents:

  - A short letter of motivation
  - A CV 
  - The Transcripts of Records for both Bachelor and Master degrees, containing the list of courses taken and grades achieved.
  - Names and email addresses of people who could provide a recommendation/reference letter (between two and five)
  - Additional relevant documents: diplomas, certificates, theses, project reports, or published articles

The letter of motivation's purpose is to assess your interest and motivation in pursuing research in the field of Decentralized Resource-constrained Machine Learning, and the match with the eDIAMOND project's goals.
For example, you can mention:

  - Your achievements and awards (e.g., participation to coding competitions, math olympiads, etc.) and how they can benefit eDIAMOND
  - The strengths of your best scientific projects (e.g., thesis, report, article) and their relevance to eDIAMOND
  - New ideas on how to carry out research and design novel methods to specifically achieve the eDIAMOND goals (see Job description section)
  - How to extend our previous works (see [**DISCO publications**](http://disco.ethz.ch/publications.html) and [**Dr. Di Maio**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCiOjOAAAAAJ&hl=en)) towards the eDIAMOND's goals
  - The subjects in which you have achieved excellent grades and how they are relevant to the project
  - Anything else that you believe is worth knowing about you and that will be essential for the project's success.

Questions regarding the position should be directed to Antonio Di Maio, [**antonio.dimaio@unibe.ch**](mailto:antonio.dimaio@unibe.ch) (no applications). For further information about the hosting group please visit the website [**DISCO**](https://disco.ethz.ch/).
