The algorithm does not rely on color information but mainly on shape information, using the HOG classifier, and on local brightness information, using the optical flow algorithm. We tried to keep the algorithm as light as possible, envisioning its future application on embedded or mobile devices. After several tests, performed modeling the system as a set of SISO feedback-controlled systems and calculating the Integral Squared Error as quality indicator, we noticed that the final performance, overall satisfactory, degrades as the background complexity and the presence of disturbance sources, such as sharp edges and moving objects that cross the target, increase .},

	abstract = {Infrastructure-less communications between moving vehicles present emblematic challenges because of high node mobility and link volatility, which may harm the performances of different categories of emerging vehicular applications. In order to move data between vehicles that are not in direct communication range, several distributed routing protocols have been proposed and tested in vehicular networks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Some previous works report disagreeing claims about routing protocol performances in similar vehicular scenarios. Therefore, in this work, we evaluate the performances in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), packet delay, frame collision rate, and signaling rate of three well-known routing protocols (AODV, DSDV, and GPSR), simulating them in a realistic Manhattan scenario. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of typical urban obstacles (e.g. buildings) on the considered performance metrics. We observed that, in the proposed urban scenario, AODV provided the best PDR, GPSR the best packet delay, and DSDV failed to provide satisfactory performances due to signaling-induced congestion. Simulations showed that considering the shadowing effects induced by the buildings in an urban scenario drastically changes the observed performances, i.e. reduces the frame collisions, decreases the PDR, and increases the packet delay.},

This variety in applications and services calls for mechanisms able to optimize content storing, retrieval and forwarding among vehicles, without jeopardizing network resources. Content Centric Networking (CCN), takes advantage of inherent content redundancy in the network in order to decrease the utilization of network resources, improve response time and content availability, coping efficiently with some of the effects of mobility. Floating Content (FC), on the other hand, holds potential to implement efficiently a large amount of vehicular applications thanks to its property of geographic content replication, while Software Defined Networking (SDN), is an attractive solution for the lack of flexibility and dynamic programmability that characterizes current VANET architectures. By implementing a logical centralization of the network, SDN enables dynamic and efficient management of network resources. In this paper, for a few reference scenarios, we illustrate how approaches that combine CCN, FC and SDN enable an innovative adaptive VANET architecture able to efficiently accommodate to intermittent connectivity, fluctuating node density and mobility patterns on one side and application performance and network resources on the other side, aiming to achieve high QoS. For each scenario, we highlight the main open research challenges, and we describe possible solutions to improve content dissemination and reduce replication without affecting content availability.},

Ensuring this balance is challenging in vehicular networks, which are characterized by a high dynamism of the network topology, volatility of intervehicular links, and heterogeneity of the exchanged content. For these reasons, we hereby introduce ROADNET, a cooperative content dissemination scheme for VANETs. Leveraging on the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, ROADNET provides a trade-off between network throughput and user fairness by exploiting the logical centralized control of SDN and the multichannel operation of the IEEE 1609.4 standard.

	abstract = {5G-enabled vehicular networks will soon allow their users to exchange safety and non-safety related information over heterogeneous communication interfaces. Routing vehicular data flows over multi-hop Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications is one of the hardest challenges in vehicular networking, and it has been tackled in literature by using distributed algorithms. The distributed approach has shown significant inefficiencies in such dynamic vehicular scenarios, mainly due to poor network congestion control. To overcome the complexity of the envisioned architecture, and the inefficiency of distributed routing algorithms, we hereby propose to leverage the coordination capabilities of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to determine optimal V2V multi-hop paths and to offload traffic from the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (V2I2V) to the V2V communications, using both cellular and Wi-Fi technologies. In order to achieve this goal, we propose Multi-Flow Congestion-Aware Routing (MFCAR), a centralized routing algorithm that relies on graph theory to choose short and uncongested V2V paths. Realistic simulations prove that MFCAR outperforms well- established centralized routing algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra's) in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), goodput and average packet delay, up to a five-fold performance gain.},

	abstract = {The increasing interest in vehicular communications draws attention to scalability and network congestion problems and therefore on techniques to offload the traffic, typically carried through the infrastructure, to the Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network. Floating content (FC) represents a promising paradigm to share ephemeral content without direct support from infrastructure. It is based on constraining geographically within the Anchor Zone (AZ) the opportunistic replication of a given content among vehicles, in a way that strikes a balance between minimization of resource usage and content availability. Existing works on FC performance modeling are based on standard, homogeneous synthetic mobility models, and it is hence unclear how they actually fit in realistic mobility scenarios. Moreover, the approaches to FC dimensioning they propose assume users have full knowledge of Spatio-temporal mobility patterns, which is hard to achieve in practice. Finally, despite FC is an infrastructure-less communication paradigm, some form of infrastructure support could be available in the vast majority of those application scenarios for which it has been proposed. In this paper, we perform a first attempt at tackling these issues. We focus on how to dimension an Anchor Zone in a realistic vehicular scenario. We propose the first set of simple dimensioning strategies, based on the estimation of some key mobility parameters and of FC performance. We assess such strategies on measurement-based vehicular traces, providing a first indication of their relative performance, and of the feasibility of FC in practical scenarios.},

	abstract = {The demand for safe and secure journeys over roads and highways has been growing at a tremendous pace over recent decades. At the same time, the smart city paradigm has emerged to improve citizens’ quality of life by developing the smart mobility concept. Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) are widely recognized to be instrumental in realizing such concept, by enabling appealing safety and infotainment services. Such networks come with their own set of challenges, which range from managing high node mobility to securing data and user privacy. The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has been identified as a suitable solution for dealing with the dynamic network environment, the increased number of connected devices, and the heterogeneity of applications. While some preliminary investigations have been already conducted to check the applicability of the SDN paradigm to VANETs, and its presumed benefits for managing resources and mobility, it is still unclear what impact SDN will have on security and privacy. Security is a relevant issue in VANETs, because of the impact that threats can have on drivers’ behavior and quality of life. This paper opens a discussion on the security threats that future SDN-enabled VANETs will have to face, and investigates how SDN could be beneficial in building new countermeasures. The analysis is conducted in real use cases (smart parking, smart grid of electric vehicles, platooning, and emergency services), which are expected to be among the vehicular applications that will most benefit from introducing an SDN architecture.},

	abstract = {Over the past years, vehicular networking has enabled a wide range of new applications that improve vehicular safety, efficiency, comfort, and environmental impact. Vehicular networks, however, normally operate in communication-hostile environments and are characterized by dynamic topologies and volatile links, making it challenging to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) and reliability of vehicular applications. To this end, the present work explores how the centralized coordination offered by Software-Defined Networking can improve the Quality of Service in vehicular networks, particularly for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) unicast routing and content dissemination. With regard to V2V routing, this work motivates the case for centralized network coordination by studying the performance of traditional MANET routing protocols when applied to urban VANETs, showing that they cannot provide satisfactory performance for modern vehicular applications because of their limited global network awareness, slow convergence, and high signaling. Hence, this work proposes and validates a centralized Multi-Flow Congestion-Aware Routing (MFCAR) algorithm to allocate multiple data flows on V2V routes. The first novelty of MFCAR is the SDN-based node-busyness estimation technique. The second novelty is the enhancement of the path-cost formulation as a linear combination of path length and path congestion, allowing the user application to fine-tune its QoS requirements between throughput and delay. Concerning content dissemination, this work proposes a Fairness- and Throughput-Enhanced Scheduling for Content Dissemination in VANETs (ROADNET), a centralized strategy to improve the tradeoff between data throughput and user fairness in deterministic vehicular content dissemination. ROADNET’s main novelties are the design of a graph-based multi-channel transmission scheduler and the enforcement of a transmission-priority policy that prevents user starvation. As additional contributions, the present work proposes a heuristic for the centralized selection of opportunistic content dissemination parameters and discusses the main security issues in Software-Defined Vehicular Networking (SDVN) along with possible countermeasures. The proposed techniques are evaluated in realistic scenarios (LuST), using discrete-event network simulators (OMNeT++) and microscopic vehicular-mobility simulators (SUMO). It is shown that MFCAR can improve PDR, throughput and delay for unicast V2V routing up to a five-fold gain over traditional algorithms. ROADNET can increase content dissemination throughput by 36\% and user fairness by 6\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, balancing the load over multiple channels with
a variance below 1\%.},

In this article, we introduce a framework for distributed learning over Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which manages data applications in a fully distributed setting across edge servers, thus reducing the cost of collecting user information in a centralized server. We couple the proposed distributed learning with a novel similarity metric for user trajectories, which can aggregate neural network models with similar costs as other model aggregation techniques. However, the aggregation technique can achieve much higher accuracy. Furthermore, we apply the proposed distributed learning scheme to manage and deploy flying base stations to areas that experience high demand or poor user connectivity, thus optimizing connectivity in terms of user satisfaction, delay, and network throughput.},

	abstract = {The Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm promises to enhance network flexibility and scalability through resource virtualization. MEC allows telecom operators to fulfill the stringent and heterogeneous requirements of 5G applications via service deployment at the edge of the mobile network. However, current solutions to support MEC struggle to provide resource elasticity since MEC infrastructures have limited resources. The coexistence of many heterogeneous services on the distributed MEC infrastructure makes the resource scarcity problem even more challenging than it already is in traditional networks. Services need distinct resource provisioning patterns due to their diverse requirements, and we may not assume an extensive MEC infrastructure that can accommodate an arbitrary number of services. To address these aspects, we present REACT: a MEC-suppoRted sElf-adaptive elAstiCiTy mechanism that leverages resource provisioning among different services running on a shared MEC environment. REACT adopts an adaptive and solidarity-based strategy to redistribute resources from over-provisioned services to under-provisioned services in MEC environments. REACT is an alternative strategy to avoid service migration due to resource scarcity. Real testbed results show that REACT outperforms Kubernetes’ elasticity strategy by accomplishing up to 18.88\% more elasticity events, reducing service outages by up to 95.1\%, reducing elasticity attempts by up to 95.36\%, and reducing over-provisioned resources by up to 33.88\%, 38.41\%, and 73\% for CPU cycles, RAM and bandwidth resources, respectively. Finally, REACT reduces response time by up to 15.5\%.},

Running ML tasks on the cloud can introduce network delay, throughput, and privacy concerns, whereas running ML tasks on IoT devices is penalized by their constrained resources. For this reason, recent research proposed cooperative execution of ML tasks over IoT networks but disregarded resource variability and the IoT devices’ energy constraints simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Early Exit of Computation (EEoC), an adaptive, energy-efficient, low-latency inference scheme over IoT networks. EEoC adaptively distributes the inference computation load between the IoT device and the edge server, based on estimated communication and computation resources, to jointly minimize prediction latency and energy consumption. We evaluate our solution’s latency and energy profile on a real testbed running two widely used neural networks.

	abstract = {Anticipating future locations of mobile users plays a pivotal role in intelligent services supporting mobile networks. Predicting user trajectories is a crucial task not only from the perspective of facilitating smart cities but also of significant importance in network management, such as handover optimization, service migration, and the caching of services in a mobile and edge-computing network. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be successful to tackle the forecasting of mobile users’ future locations. However, designing effective CNN architectures is challenging due to their large hyper-parameter space. Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) mechanisms have been proposed to optimize the neural network design process, but they are computationally expensive and they have not been used to predict user mobility. In large urban scenarios, the rate at which mobility information is generated makes it a challenge to optimize, train, and maintain prediction models for individual users. However, considering that user trajectories are not independent, a common trajectory-prediction model can be built and shared among a set of users characterized by similar mobility features. In the present work, we introduce Reinforcement Convolutional Transfer Learning (RC-TL), a CNN-based trajectory-prediction system that clusters users with similar trajectories, dedicates a single RL agent per cluster to optimize a CNN neural architecture, trains one model per cluster using the data of a small user subset, and transfers it to the other users in the cluster. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset show that our proposed RL-based CNN achieves up to 12\% higher trajectory-prediction accuracy, with no training speed reduction, over other state-of-the-art approaches on a large-scale, real-world mobility dataset. Moreover, RC-TL’s clustering strategy saves up to 90\% of the computational resources needed for training compared to single-user models, in exchange for a 3\% accuracy reduction.},

These metrics depend on the sum of computation and network latency needed to generate and deliver a video frame to the Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and the power consumption on the HMD. Recent research shows that Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) can support mobile HMDs to reduce their computing latency, but its potential to maintain the acceptable end-to-end (E2E) latency and reduce power consumption under high mobility conditions remains unexplored. This paper proposes Service Chaining Graph (SCG), an orchestrator to split VR applications into atomic services and deploy them across HMDs and MEC servers according to an optimization problem that aims to jointly minimize latency and energy consumption. Through simulations, we show that SCG reduces E2E latency by up to 74\% in three high-mobility userdense scenarios compared to four widely used service-migration strategies against a moderate increase in power consumption. Unlike other approaches, SCG can find a balance between average latency and energy consumption by migrating services between MEC servers and HMDs according to a policy depending on application requirements.},

Unlike state-of-the-art social-aware trajectory predictors that either miss the large-distance interactions or are computationally expensive due to the pooling of all users’ interactions, INTRAFORCE clusters users with similar trajectories and learns their interactions. INTRAFORCE performs Neural Architecture Search to optimize each transformer’s architecture to fit each cluster’s user mobility features using Reinforcement Learning. Through experimental validation, we show that INTRAFORCE outperforms several state-of-the-art trajectory predictors on five widely used smallscale pedestrian mobility datasets and one large-scale privacyoriented cellular mobility dataset by achieving lower prediction error, training time, and computational complexity.

	abstract = {Distributed training of Machine Learning models in edge Internet of Things (IoT) environments is challenging because of three main points. First, resource-constrained devices have large training times and limited energy budget. Second, resource heterogeneity of IoT devices slows down the training of the global model due to the presence of slower devices (stragglers). Finally, varying operational conditions, such as network bandwidth, and computing resources, significantly affect training time and energy consumption. Recent studies have proposed Split Learning (SL) for distributed model training with limited resources but its efficient implementation on the resource-constrained and decentralized heterogeneous IoT devices remains minimally explored. We propose Adaptive REsource-aware Split-learning (ARES), a scheme for efficient model training in IoT systems. ARES accelerates training in resource-constrained devices and minimizes the effect of stragglers on the training through device-targeted split points while accounting for time-varying network throughput and computing resources. ARES takes into account application constraints to mitigate training optimization tradeoffs in terms of energy consumption and training time. We evaluate ARES prototype on a real testbed comprising heterogeneous IoT devices running a widely-adopted deep neural network and dataset. Results show that ARES accelerates model training on IoT devices by up to 48\% and minimizes the energy consumption by up to 61.4\% compared to Federated Learning (FL) and classic SL, without sacrificing model convergence and accuracy.},

	abstract = {In dynamic settings, fully distributed gossip-based learning schemes have recently gained interest due to their better scalability, robustness, and enhanced privacy protection compared to server-based architectures. However, existing approaches to their performance characterization either assume stable connectivity among nodes or are ad-hoc for specific trace-based mobility patterns. Thus, in dynamic settings, there is currently a poor understanding of the conditions under which gossip-based learning schemes are feasible, and of their main performance tradeoffs. In this work, we start addressing this issue by performing a first baselining of Gossip Learning (GL) on random Time-Varying Graphs (TVG), to get a first-order characterization of their main performance patterns in dynamic settings. The use of random TVG enables a fine-grained and accurate characterization of GL effectiveness as a function of the main system parameters while abstracting from scenariospecific features of patterns of communication and mobility (e.g., induced by road grids or measured mobility traces). Our results suggest that GL schemes are robust to node mobility and comparable in accuracy and convergence speed to Federated Learning architectures, over a wide range of operational conditions. We show that the final model accuracy is robust against data dispersion across nodes as well as against very low rates of exchanges across nodes.},

However, accurate temperature measurements can be compromised by factors such as direct sunlight, leading to overheating and inaccurate readings. We propose a Machine Learning-based approach that addresses this challenge by dynamically ventilating the sensor environment using small fans, enabling accurate and energy-efficient temperature measurements. This paper focuses on two interconnected problems: predicting steady-state temperature using a limited window of initial temperature measurements and investigating the impact of ventilation time. We employ various DNNs suitable for low-power IoT sensor devices to predict temperature using multivariate time series from different sensors and compare their accuracy. Furthermore, we highlight the tradeoff between prediction accuracy, which is correlated to the length of the observed input sequence, and energy consumption dependent on ventilation time. By adopting advanced prediction techniques, we can develop efficient IoT systems for accurate and energy-efficient environment monitoring in smart cities.},

	abstract = {With the fast growth of the Internet ofThings, location-based services are becoming more important for quality-relevantapplications. Quality-relevant applications often require to be auditable inorder to ensure quality of products and services. However, positioning systemstypically only provide position claims that are not secured and can be forgedor manipulated. This work proposes an auditable positioning system to tacklethis issue. The proposed system performs a proof of location to assert that thetracked asset tag was at the claimed position and immutably stores thisinformation on a distributed ledger. Additionally, an adaptive storage rate wasproposed to save disk storage on the distributed ledgers. A testbed based onBluetooth's Angle of Arrival positioning was implemented for the evaluation ofthe auditable positioning system. The evaluation shows that auditablepositioning is secure, feasible for low-power devices, and that adaptivestorage rates can significantly reduce disk usage and improve scalability.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has become popular in the field of mobility and trajectory prediction due to its privacy-preserving and scalability capabilities. Deploying FL over resource-constrained devices and varying network conditions is challenging for achieving a good tradeoff among prediction performance, computational load, and communication volume. On the other hand, the design of FL’s distributed neural architectures is complex, time-consuming, and dependent on experts’ prior knowledge. To tackle the above limitations, we propose the network-adaptive FEDerated learning for reinFORCEd mobility prediction (FedForce) system. FedForce employs reinforcement learning to design a transformer neural network whose architecture jointly optimizes the prediction accuracy, training time, and transmission time based on the mobility dataset’s unique features, the client’s computing capacity, and the available network throughput. FedForce outperforms several state-of-theart trajectory predictors and achieves an average displacement error of 0.20m on the ETH+UCY dataset and an accuracy of 76\% on the Orange dataset (-0.02m and 10\% higher than the bestperforming baseline, respectively), while cutting the FL training and transmission time by half. FedForce can save up to 80\% of computational resources and 96\% of communication overheads with a negligible accuracy decrease.},

	abstract = {Positioning estimations of wireless sensors can be enhanced via sensor collaboration. To enable this, various methods have been proposed; yet, most do not leverage the entire collective knowledge, which also involves the estimation’s uncertainty. In this article, we introduce Anchor-free Ranging-Likelihood-based Cooperative Localization (ARLCL); a novel anchor-free and technology-agnostic localization algorithm that utilizes inter-exchanged ranging signals from sensors to enable their simultaneous positioning. Ranging technologies with easy-to-model propagation properties, such as UWB or LiDAR are among the first beneficiaries that ARLCL is targeting. To examine its applicability, however, even to signals that are noisier and often unsuitable for ranging, we assess ARLCL with real-world BLE RSS measurements. At the same time, we consider deployments that typically induce flip-ambiguity, being a major problem in cooperative localization. We provide an extensive comparison against the most widely-adopted optimization method (Mass-Spring) but also against the recent likelihood-based approach (Maximum Likelihood - Particle Swarm Optimization). The results showed that ARLCL outperformed the baselines in almost all scenarios. Our gain in positioning accuracy is also found to be positively correlated to both the swarm’s size and the signal’s quality, reaching an improvement of 40\%.},

The data collected from such smartphone devices can be used to observe, recognize and predict patterns in user behaviors such as physical activity, psycho-physiological conditions such as affective state, personality traits such as extraversion, emotionality, and honesty-humility, as well as other mental health-related or psychological variables. In this work, we design and develop a system that can be used for the unobtrusive collection and storage of anonymized smartphone sensor data for personality detection and prediction. Our proposed system is developed across the two main smartphone operating systems to cover a wide range of users and to consider the available sensors across platform-dependent devices, as well as to account for distinctions in the personality traits of users of different operating systems. We present a correlation analysis and describe how the dataset collected from the smartphone sensors, which were deployed in a large-scale psychology study with about 200 participants, can be used to detect and predict different personality states.},

Therefore, an attacker might be able to manipulate or forge locations. SecureAoX uses basic cryptographic functions and the contradictions between the Angle of Arrival measured on the anchor points and the Angle of Departure measured on the asset tag to verify location claims and detect manipulated and forged locations. A Monte Carlo simulation used to evaluate the performance of the detection algorithm shows that the approach is efficient in detecting attacks and real-world Angle of Arrival accuracy measurements show that the approach is feasible in real-world scenarios. In conclusion, SecureAoX can detect forged and manipulated positions that are further away from the attacked positions than the uncertainty of the used Positioning System.},

	abstract = {Network Slicing has emerged as a powerful technique to enable cost-effective, multi-tenant communications and services over a shared physical mobile network infrastructure. One major challenge of service provisioning in slice-enabled networks is the uncertainty in the demand for the limited network resources that must be shared among existing slices and potentially new Network Slice Requests. In this paper, we consider admission control of Network Slice Requests in an online setting, with the goal of maximizing the long-term revenue received from admitted requests. We model the Slice Admission Control problem as an Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problem and present two reservation-based policies and their algorithms, which have a competitive performance for Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problems. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the performance of our online admission control method in terms of average revenue gained by the Infrastructure Provider, system resource utilization, and the ratio of accepted slice requests. We compare our approach with those of the online First Come First Serve greedy policy. The simulation's results prove that our proposed online policies increase revenues for Infrastructure Providers by up to 12.9 \% while reducing the average resource consumption by up to 1.7\% In particular, when the tenants' economic inequality increases, an Infrastructure Provider who adopts our proposed online admission policies gains higher revenues compared to an Infrastructure Provider who adopts First Come First Serve.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has rapidly become a crucial paradigm for training Machine Learning (ML) models when datasets are spread across several devices without compromising the privacy of the data owners. In vehicular networks, FL can be used to train driving models and object detection and classification over sensitive datasets to continuously improve user experience and driving safety. However, the majority of FL implementations cannot efficiently filter malicious vehicular users and low-quality contributions. This article proposes Distributed OT-based Federated Learning (DOTFL), an aggregation mechanism based on the clustering of the received trained Neural Networks Neural Network (NN) at the vehicular devices and on outlier detection. The proposed mechanism can detect malicious contributions by comparing them to previously received contributions and following a clustering approach. Furthermore, the convergence time of the FL process is improved by distributing trained NN weights directly through vehicle-to-vehicle links. Experimental analysis shows an improvement of up to 22\% in terms of accuracy compared to state-of-the-art FL approaches. This is achieved by using clustering models and removing outliers, enabling a significantly lower presence of malicious contributions in aggregated models.},

	abstract = {Fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks are expected to support the dynamic provisioning of services with heterogeneous Quality of Service requirements through Network Slicing. However, the uncertainty in the resource requirements of the tenant's future Network Slice Requests raises the problem of how Network Slices can be admitted onto the mobile network infrastructure. To address this, we investigate the Slice Admission Control problem in virtualization-enabled mobile networks. Specifically, we focus on the scenario in which a controller needs to select an Admission Control policy (or algorithm) based on the patterns of previous Network Slice Requests and formulate such a problem as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem. By leveraging Online Learning (OL), we propose a framework, Drift-AwaRe upper confIdence bOund (DARIO), that adaptively selects and learns the performance of online Slice Admission Control (SAC) policies by monitoring for changes in the underlying patterns of Network Slice Request (NSR) features. We evaluate the performance of our framework in terms of the relative gains in average revenue, acceptance ratio, and average resource utilization when compared to both static and adaptive baselines and show that we outperform the considered baselines for the considered metrics.},
